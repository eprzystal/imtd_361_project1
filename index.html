	    <h1>A little about me</h1>
		  <img src="images/elizabethprzystal.jpg" alt="Elizabeth Przystal">
		  <h3>Hello, my name is Elizabeth Przystal.</h3>
		  <p>I was born and raised in Chicago.  My summers as a child I would visit my father's family in a town outside of Quito, Ecuador.
		  This shaped my childhood and I have a fascination with the Ecuadorian culture and landscape.  The terrain in Ecuador is ever changing depending on the town. 
		  All of these images were taken on my last trip to Ecuador.  You can see how the landscape and vegetation change depending on your elevation.</p>
